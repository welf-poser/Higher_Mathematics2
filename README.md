# Higher_Mathematics2
During the "Higher Mathematics 2" Class in University i had to programm lots of mathematical and numerical procedures.

These files include a functioning library for working with vectors and matrices, programs for the Euler´s method and a Monte Carlos Simulation for a lottery. 

The tasks from my University are described in the pdf´s but they are in german.
